    My work, projects, and knowledge is constantly growing and evolving to be better. I am persistently learning and continually maturing as a programmer. My thirst to know more is never quenched and my hunger to be better will never be satisfied.

        Being able to express my creativity with my own hands and mind has always been something I love doing. I have done so in my spare time, but never thought it was achievable on this scale. After being stuck in a job I do not love, and feeling like life can be so much more, I finally kicked myself in the behind to do what I want to do. So come and be a part of my journey!
